# ORA-01400 Error Resolution Guide

## Problem Description
The error `ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into ("C##SAHILP"."PAYEE"."PAYEE_ID")` occurs when trying to add a new payee because the database sequence is not properly generating IDs.

## Root Cause
The Oracle sequence `PAYEE_SEQ` either:
1. Does not exist
2. Is not properly configured
3. Has insufficient privileges

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Execute the Fix Script
Run the following SQL commands directly in your Oracle database:

```sql
-- Connect as C##SAHILP or as SYSDBA
-- Execute the fix_payee_sequence.sql script

-- Verify current sequence status
SELECT sequence_name, last_number, increment_by 
FROM user_sequences 
WHERE sequence_name = 'PAYEE_SEQ';

-- If sequence doesn't exist, create it:
CREATE SEQUENCE PAYEE_SEQ
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NOCACHE
    NOCYCLE;

-- Test the sequence
SELECT PAYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;
```

### Step 2: Verify Entity Configuration
The Payee entity is already properly configured with:
- `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "payee_seq")`
- `@SequenceGenerator(name = "payee_seq", sequenceName = "PAYEE_SEQ", allocationSize = 1)`

### Step 3: Test the Fix
After executing the sequence creation, test by adding a new payee through the application.

### Step 4: Monitor for Success
Check the application logs for successful payee creation without ORA-01400 errors.

## Manual Testing Commands

```sql
-- Check if sequence exists
SELECT * FROM user_sequences WHERE sequence_name = 'PAYEE_SEQ';

-- Check table structure
DESC PAYEE;

-- Test sequence manually
SELECT PAYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;
```

## Expected Results
After implementing this fix:
- Payee creation should succeed without ORA-01400 errors
- New payees should receive auto-generated IDs starting from 1
- The application should work normally
